A simple, easy to use vanilla JS (no dependencies) color picker with alpha selection.

#### Demo

## Getting Started

#### Installing

* For the pros:

  + ```npm install vanilla-picker --save```
  + ```import Picker from 'vanilla-picker';```

* For the rest of us:

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vanilla-picker@2"></script>
```

> **_Note:_**
> 
> The script adds a `<style>` element to the page, with all the needed CSS. If your site's [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) doesn't allow that, use the CSP build with a separate CSS file instead:
> ```
> import Picker from 'vanilla-picker/csp';
> import 'vanilla-picker/dist/vanilla-picker.csp.css';
> ```
> ..or
> ```
> <script src="vanilla-picker.csp.min.js"></script>
> <link  href="vanilla-picker.csp.css" rel="stylesheet">
> ```

#### Usage

```html
<div id="parent">Click me</div>

<script>

    /*
        Create a new Picker instance and set the parent element.
        By default, the color picker is a popup which appears when you click the parent.
    */
    var parent = document.querySelector('#parent');
    var picker = new Picker(parent);

    /*
        You can do what you want with the chosen color using two callbacks: onChange and onDone.
    */
    picker.onChange = function(color) {
        parent.style.background = color.rgbaString;
    };

    /* onDone is similar to onChange, but only called when you click 'Ok' */

</script>
```

## Accessibility

The color picker is built to support basic keyboard navigation and use with screen readers.
I would be very interested in feedback on improvements that could be done here!
